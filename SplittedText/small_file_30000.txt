probably best phone yet including pixel 2 know nothing complaint jack top also back pretty ugly oval around camera hideous 
lg v20 best phone 2017 2016 features minus waterproofing high quality aluminum construction removable battery mil spec drop rating etc disappointed see lg going direction though make money horrible power user v series originally targeted though 
still note 8 new iphonelg always remained okayish sales market phones lowand seriously design note 8 much better thisstill good great 
tbh really liked secondary screen v20 maybe others didnt use much like life always could use time wanted notifications didnt come way main display really helped playing games also taking screenshots im kinda sad v30 ditched feature 
lg v30 samsung galaxy note 8 rock 2017 beastly android phones üèÜüèÜüò§üò§üèÜüèÜ would nice removable batteries thoughüòÖ

floating phone trick blew freaking mind 
theyve taken away best bits v series imo second screen removable battery way microsd card thank god still atleast goes might dual sim get everybody uses taking away made lose interest especially since part reasoning get waterproofing achievable without wireless charging 
thing liked lg v20 wide angle camera otherwise pretty disappointing decided get note 8 instead since loved note 7 snatched hands
