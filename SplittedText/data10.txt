review matters 
best dude

mean kinda obvious placed fingerprintÂ sensor back wanted users use iris scanner ofteni mean common sensethey trynna things differentunlike apple 
back button left user wants prefer right 
one going flop year 
finally use screen navigation buttons like theyre â€‹supposed theyre still wrong position

navbar looks ugly s8 couldnt include one gesture mode like moto g5 plus 
iris scanner phones gradually stealing identity bit bit 
ugly design horrible fingerprint scanner placement redundant assistant rip continuum likely ultra expensive nno thanks samsung never owned crappy phones never bad apple 
gorgeous cant wait note 8 
like lg g6 better 
hopefully dex feature hardware side rather software ported old device like galaxy note 4 ğŸ˜‚ know nougat capable multitasking windows like dex better note 4s multiwindows 
one reviewer say processor ram s8s 
s7 edge still rocks dont think ill need upgrade time soon 
camera capture raw files 
hmmm 
question always ask every new phone install apps sd card 
fingerprint reader high kind ruining whole point easy reach looks stupid talk smuges camera also anyone else find glarereflection infinity pool style edges distracting hell 
either south korea opposite majority people left handed samsung money left pay ergonomics department thats logical explanation placement fingerprint scanner 
iphone 7 much better fingerprint scanner better speakers great camera lagfree os regular updates list goes 
bought s7 like year ago release new phone one price dropped 
great looking hardware best class screen im sure laggy software 
headphone jack rare sight 
think lg g6 look stronger body s8 s8 gorgeous phone lets wait see think samsung galaxy s8 line sales beat flagship sale company

beautiful phone awesome video kinda really want one im note guy 
well voice galaxy grand neo google assistant watch 
lg g6 seems promising fingerprint scanner small battery camera improvements probably ridiculous price leaks said starting 750 dealbreakers opinion bad apple leaving headphone jack miss 
back button right guys

pricing bestbuycom

dwight schrute 
love videos michael hair point must mentioned 
im really excited desktop feature 
wan na see lil wayne pour champagne phone 
got headphone jack waterproof im love 
im still happy oneplus3t 
improved exploding feature 
dont get wrong critic people comment sections pure imbeciles experience yes guts say actually eversoawkward placement fingerprint scanner well actually bad would expect coming guy came see s8 well first saw actually thought finger print scanner placement huge fiasco comes realization get used finger print scanner placement later plus thered reason use fingerprint scanner since one called gimick thought gimick named iris scanner actually works fast fingerprint scanner whereas multiplies rate security really phone flaws still fingerprint scanner arguement pretty much misleading 
bruh wtf hair 
nice short look audio s7 wasnt great departmentdid fix year 
cant hide buttons 
google made car would called google drive 
phone manufacturers ever give us year year bigger screen phone size ratio less bezels higher ram better camera new placement fingerprint scanner home buttons phone jack battery give us something enough last days look next best thing end looking next charging spot 
hate curved screen wish could get specs lg g6 
sure purdy 
great video would describe s8s haptic feedback similar iphone taptic engine feel good iphones 
come 128gb variant sd cards slow phone fuck downnnn 
fan round screen edges 
damn fingerprint location disappointment 
phablet 
ballers dont buy samsung 
im waiting galaxy s9 rumors 
overhyped phone disappointment nothing see 
like ur waiting note 8 
phone looks gorgeous 
problem removing physical home button accidentally pressing home button instead keyboard space bar especially thin bottom bezels another ergonomical nightmare typical copycat fashion samsung offered us tactile feedback like iphone 7 another moving part wear vibrate ruin battery life samsung always secondrate manufacturer like 1990s early 2000s bplayer using copycat marketing learned apple also bplayer 1990s prior jobs return quality manufacturers like nokia motorola panasonic durable longlasting products need fuck samsung 
gorgeous smartphone top line specs 
iphone home botton 
still happy oneplus 3t dashcharge 6gb ram instant fingerprint reader 
wish hadnt gotten lg v20 replacement note7 patience wait 6 months sigh 
hmmm im kinda digging fingerprint sensor location pretty awkward might give test drive see like 
like thin bezels give taller screens large phones phones fit hand 
s8 day long 
cant help feeling samsung went conservative approach time round hoped something better 
3000mah battery wonder thats enough seems low point phone apart ridiculous fingerprint sensor placement 
dont know everyone complain nice could done better still really nice 
god navigation buttons awful looking ğŸ¤¢ 
daaam nailed design one looks like years ahead s7 somewhat dissapointing though look hood 
one gorgeous looking phone remember s5 looks like wow improvement better looking iphone time one best looking phone 
howwwwwwwwww much 
samy back stronger ever tremendous phone bigly leap smartphone design phone tall could used wall phone beautiful want grab bzlz ladies gents may present new galaxy s8 plus 
man im torn samsung capability making amazing phones try compete wrong things google assistant already great youre going put android phones youll get waste resources bixby make worse skimped fingerprint reader like wth placement much rather samsung develop screen fingerprint sensor bixby 
didnt think fingerprint placement would badbut considering nothing terms increasing battery unacceptable 
damn black pretty nicer shade black s7 edge also like metal band sides black wish migrated updates ui s7 guess forget 
great hardware software android still cant daily driver app quality still never live life without imessage samsung nailed design apples phone year better blow everyones mind hardware wise want phone running ios 
back right patrician way use smartphone 
real innovation dont let phone companies trick asked comments worth upgrade 
still waiting android n update note 5 done android bought iphone 7 get updates asap 
holy fucking shit black s8 fucking pretty honestly say event shit bixbie seems like bunch crap 
shouldnt used green background technical specifications makes hard read texts 
super hesitant grab phone due prevalent bixby seems os resembles halfbaked svoice thank

ive owned several galaxys previously looks like nice phone im still going lg g6 dual camera much killer feature whereas s8 simply polished evolution except truly ridiculous fingerprint scanner placement gimmicky bixby silly price rather game changing usable innovation g6

software stuff going make gs7 
looking forward new iphone 
fingerprint scanner location high koreans long fingers 
thought asian man black first glance due lighting lol 
omg people got stop calling infiniti screen clearly s6 edge minus home button 
vs lg g6 
controversial opinion like back button right makes sense right handed like people use phone one hand dont strech across screen hit back key doesnt really matter small screen short fingers like large galaxy s7 edge screen makes sense

getting s7 edge last year told wont get samsung anymore theyre expensive buy expensive repair plus glass breaks easily watching s8 looks like might change mind 
back button belongs right always 
nah bro got zte zmax pro im used handling large itemsğŸ˜ 
kinda think display looks overkill 
5 inch google pixel 1080p screen likely higher fps benchmarks due resolution 
bootloader unlockable get aosp 
sd capable 
sad phone going best selling smartphone samsung 
mint sim stuff legit 
buautiful 
sexy phone ill give 
wait isolinear chips towards end video 
back button right side dont want stretch thumb one end another go back 
wish etching stars galaxy back phoneit looks dull 
sell 1 free fire extinguisher iphone still feels expensive premium copycat lol 
shouldnt like back button right time changed huawei also lets customize layout buttons 
worst update since galaxy s6s6 edge offered smaller battery kept sealed since waterresistance microsd slot s8 basically s7 edge removing home button increasing display size vertically offering voice assistant nobody use like iphone 6s went 7 three years right amount time notice actual improvements endless yearly updates 
galaxy s7 means dont need phone time soon 
ran gta 5 s8 definitely blowup ğŸ˜‚

dont know whos attractive looking phone michael Â you look sharp man keep good work 
someone speedtest pls 
soooo plus version replacement note minus pen note8 going thing 
ughhhhh really looking forward keyone difficult decide phione hurry ass blackberry youre screwing things 
right minds would think return button right side 
dont phone companies make really good simple phone like last year htc 10 good speaker dac camera yknow improvement essential stuffs instead throwing full bunch gimmicks 
reason fingerprint scanner lackluster want open phone want everyone new irisscanner facial recognition unlock system fingerprint scanner great innovation phone safety samsung probably trying push security feature forefront less aggressively apple pushed wireless headphonesheadphone jack removal think ultimately apple little hasty overvalued phone thickness assumed people would value honest could anyone notice 3 mms difference thickness put case phone throws away efforts 
time us buy s7 cheaper price ğŸ˜‚ 
lg g6 better every aspect first come huge screen similar one better battery better camera also waterproof wireless charging etc fingerprint sensor lg right spot cheaper likely 
pre ordered mine couple hours ago uk feels like long im gon na get though april 19th im excited jump back android though 
like samsung taking last name 
expensive country samsung software always lag short time dont know like s8 dont know ğŸ™ğŸ™ğŸ™

best phone apple 8 know ios design thing nothing new 8 new 
yesit 
looks like typical samsung flagship release good intentions dragged minor inconveniences bloatware samsung app better stock 
display looks amazing even camera edge infinity display looks gorgeous 
swapping placement flash fingerprint scanner would allow us unlock phone without touching camera lens left hand since us right handed scanner right convenience masses offence lefted folks

dex optimized smartdock experience samsung introduced note ii multiwindow theyve gradually making smartdock sexier year since 2011 dont see dex making popular 
location finger print scanner could deal breaker many could stupid 
didnt like samsung android phones htc never recommend people buy samsung also somehow cool brand nowadays samsung changed mind starting s7 s8 really like concept s8 rounded display beautiful ui rounded icons good camera faster speed appealing placement fingerprint ruins everyting biggest problem fuckin htc admit samsung getting better seeing htc big improvement really want

youre trying look cool front everyone 
need three ways face time r group facetime chat 
coming apple consumer since 2011 iâ€™m thinking â€why apple even make iphone 8â€ working iphone x mightâ€™ve launched sooner 
osm ğŸ‘ŒğŸ‘ŒğŸ‘ŒğŸ‘Œ 
wouldve better iphone x less iphone 8 
6s plus 8 plus good upgrade 
animoji one iphone 88plus 
nothing new since 6 
sticking jet black 7 im gon na sit upgrades till 2nd iteration whatever iphone x going become comes also great time get discount prices iphone 7 cases instances well new selections cases fit iphone 8 7 great time many accessories choose well ability save upgrade status something really special future 
prefer iphone 8 x think bit crazy daily gestures sliding screen 
unimpressive say least lol 
yay finally create dragon fight scenes game thrones ignore boring people around 
used note 8 video 
whats asian guy sticking arm reason 
ğŸ‘ 
im getting iphone 8 im really excited see ios since used apple product 
well ive sitting iphone 5 guess would dank upgrade 
took 12 minutes phone get outdated 
called iphone 7s 7s plus x iphone 8 made bigger plus version 
even macs design world moved 2 1 n convertibles one way look change aint broke yet selling much n frankly however cool iphone x user iphone 6 plus consider dont change usage patterns yet fastest phone latest bells whistles iphone x bezzels already used 
look like iphone 7 plus jet black lol 
ã……ëŠ°ã…‚ã„·ìŠ¤ìŠ¤ 
much impressive camera seems like people want camera cellphone make phone calls naaahh im keeping phone think samsung better cellphones 
think ill stick 7 plus 
hey guys buy iphone 8 wait iphone x im interested android even though right im using crappy android phone worth buy new iphones older 6s plus 7 plus good enough ps im wanting upgrade purchase maybe get newest one last longer time 
thing youre actually paying new cpu amd camera 
pretty soon apple make ios iphone 6 obsolete need buy newer iphones money sucking vampires 
still home button 7 
everybody mad advanced buy iphone x budget option year youre getting lot phone looks like last years much better specs almost x also pricing cheaper last years pricing 8 8 plus sleeper phones everyone thinks theyre disappointing fans already selling 2 weeks back ordered
