guess stick current s7 edge fingerprint sensor back convenient far easier access front side edge phone lays flat table quickly access phone 
still typec 337 dont think old samsung phones ever usb typec 
s7 edge still sexier might pick s8 tho 
without sacrificing functionality oh brother curves make using phone considerably difficult accidental edge touches hinder functionality big time 
nexus 6 honest could trade 6 inch screen sot id love phone lot think thats going biggest bottlenecks 
make s8 vs g6 comparison video comparing specs feel experience thanks

imo think samsung better deal apple everyone keep putting iphones theyre vastly different everyone know apple users dont buy phones reasons 
sorry say went design wrong design detail detail awful example usb c port bottom entered pushed back phone screen comes far samsung evidently couldnt create thin enough screen also one main reasons apple better every way dont ship something perfect apple would wait display technology thin enough dont move usb c port apple would developed finger print system works glass rather bodging putting back front phone admit looks good back damn right ugly software pixby thing awful name swipe left doesnt even follow colour scheme rest phone looks like seperate app thats ported different os next different assistant lazy samsung needs make os wants chance competing apple poor overcomplicated attempt apple apple failed always samsung understand design detail 
donâ€™t read profile name 
im impressed phone going cost around 900 euros europe ridicules look specs better save money wait oneplus four 5 
actually back button right side look s7 also right side ğŸ˜Š

wow 
starts showin vertical pink annoying line screen 
want point screen actually much bigger phones overall size screen may 58 traditionally 55 body thats 58 diagonally since phones new aspect ratio longer diagonal length doesnt tell whole story measure actual surface area screen slightly bigger traditional 55 screen still really like think important people know theyre getting much screen real estate 
sad even wan na buy phone dont think itll survive thieves walking paris 
never used fingerprint scanner anyway could save 1 second every time open phone dont really care honest 
hey mkbhd phones actually look big mitts

says everything need know new phone 027 133 said s8 edges feels much softer much seamless feeling thats samsung calls infinity display aka ends edge begin blended size shape display called infinity display 
phone looks good everything else terrible 
really want get could never afford good phone time 
battery size seen downside super amoled screens incredibly energy efficient since every black pixel basically pixel turned top cpu new s8 also extremely energy efficient compared 8890 octa s7 altough screen bigger battery life expected better s7 
worth buying 
sceen big 835 efficient saving little power probably wont much difference even increased screen size 
huawei p9 nd look similar 
price point found moto z play far better galaxy s8 except waterproofing snapdragon 835 thats also big deal snapdragon 625 moto z play bad one smoothest processor also optimizes battery performance well device moto z play packs 3500mah battery lasts least two days sure built quality also good metal side frame fingerprint fast front cameras pretty good dualled flash rear front side laser autofocus also 35 audio jack usbtype c port fast charging technology lastly price think biggest win moto z play cost 385 25k inr could buy galaxy devices thankfully went moto z play phone must
