original pixel already oled always display know im looking would still think upgrading pixel 2 though headphone jack im willing deal dongles converting stuff bluetooth 
kind sad apple samsung made 650 sound like bargain 
took google 6 months release phone still cant beat s8 even note 
google airpod 
phone nothing new takes away old one doesnt headphone jack means completely useless use phone headphone jack charge time phone sell well dont know 
tf everybody removing headphone jack ffs people think good ideasmh 
people thumbs downing video awesome job impressions vid idiots realize thumbs downing video phone way kill peoples youtube ratings smdh 
showing pixel 2 xl title referencing pixel 2 false ad pixel 2 small bigger bezels one 
man bezeles cant thats underwhelming google known good software design cant hire better designers phones glass back shouldve like last year overlapping fingerprint scanner area looks better opinion 
size bezeles wouldnt 189 display werent think top bottom bezeles already thick maintain 189 ratio size bezeles need size 
fugly 
love google phones one bezels tho 
headphone jack 
google missed trick putting red power button black version üëé 
care software camera battery speakers dont give fuck bezels must buy 
unwritten rule phone headphone jack must come bluetooth headphones 
headphone jack buy 
u didnt mention ar features amazing stickers interact im stoked also didnt speak google focusing purely software instead hardware thats going dominate market thats apple took top spot pure software cant wait go vacation japan use pixel buds phone impressive dont need translator understand chinese people restaurants talking shit truly innovating opinion google slapped samsung apple one conference loved also iphone ois eis one im video amazing marques 
ese equipo tengo se congela mucho se si es el equipo las fotos aparentan buena calidad pero cuando lo paso la computadora ah√≠ se distingue claramente que es muy baja calidad 
original pixel headphone jack therefore phone better 
first time leaks looked way better ugly shit 
dont think active edge together side edge 
would lot better refer ai wai weak ai real ai doesnt exist right 
one ugly phones ive ever seen performance great 
think squeeze feature side bezels big 
one loves sunken bezel sides s8 always problem accidently clicking video players screen buttons side phone especially one handing phone 
fuck stop mingling linus he‚Äôs youtube spammer 
wait phone constantly listening everything thats pretty fucked 
company like google hire people design 2017 phone 
thats one ugly phone 
fuck needed make give us galaxy s8 stock android 
underrated people quick judge appearance 
think thick bezel might squeeze function dont accidently press something display 
its‚Äã nice phone think take chance iphone x 
please review pixel book also really exciting 
pixel 2 looks like stuck 2012 
hell bottom chin thinner top chin 
good things phone camera ai features performance seems pretty meh design pretty bad price might slightly redeeming factor still iphone x pixel 2 killer year 
u sound like white guy ure confusing 
personally like bezel phone gives space grip front phone reduces chance accidental touches 
anyone getting google home mini 
miles davis kind blue 
actually like much last years version 
glance feature long ago without even oled screens 
design specially bezels outdated could get top lower bezel since stereo speakers trade would willing accept side bezels also wireless charging also ill pass one 
sigh guess option get samsung laggy wont lack features 
nokia used oled screens 
front looks like lumia 950 950xl 
admit marques google deserves worst phone design award year point view flagship devices come till also couldve named google machine learning pixel 2 gmlp2 short would terrible naming though 
im sure mentioned come adapter traditional analog headphones 
im getting new phone soon im unimpressed think ill wait s9 
stick s8 
really hate design 
phone brands require secondary lens potrait mode whereas pixel nails single lens well done google clear need second lens gimmic lg wide lenses simulated single lens hence lg good go 
‚Ç¨959 euros xl spain fair price becomes crazy expensive 
pixel 2 nonxl looks like smartphone 2010 
1 cinemagraph wallpaper think something worth looking deeper kind engine runs based existing video format something make proprietary format must buy samsung store also would affect cpu usagebattery 2 think google think bezels inyourface display mere design philosophy wanted pursue something else 2017 trend plain refusal thin bezels 2017 thing 3 dont think playing detect niche music say mid east like indie kpop math rock scandinavian band forgotten euro disco 1975 know list growing im curious fast wide willing add list 4 picture quality gets point quality maybe time examine quality jpeg engine far pushed rather old traditional straight camera results mean nowadays phones good plain checking straight outofcamera jpeg results go far gets mundane 
ugly 
design microsoft paint 
screen isnt even centered vertically o0 
pixel 2 xl samsung s8 lg v30 dilemma go iv used oneplus 2 nexus 6p samsung s7 edge im iphone 7 plus wan na get back droid help

design underwhelming imo 
got bluetooth headphones speakers would agreed eliminating 35mm jack would disasterous however bluetooth wonderful invention cords dangling everywhere wonderful battery life really become much better bluetooth headphones easily last day two without charging charge way hour pairing takes less time untangling headphone cords plugging even 
playing feature locked pixel 2 phones 80 update

squeeze feature probably culprit huge side bezels also dont like 3 inches wide much unfortunately small pixel came big top lower bezels guess need wait next year phones come still going sort iphone se small pixel near bezeless design anything 45 5 inches size screen preferably 169 guess asking much 
triggered ok google hell thought match voice profile

going understand size bezels need bigger avoid touching sides screen fuck samsung hype bezels necessary thats design better others functionality comes design thing didnt realize squeeze action would interfered smaller bezels lot first dislike mkbhd video 
micro sd support case wondering think expandable storage isnt necessary anymore may point data limits shrinking getting expansive every year streaming would happily fit micro sd card would kill average persons data plan matter hours 128gb max storage option system apps formatting 
waiting video 
google reimagine design concept flagship devices like s8note 8and course iphones drsign way better thisüëéüëéüëéüëé

think phone best phone year fit wants stock android amazing software support front facing speakers yes phone coming nexus 6p user fits wants best thats ill getting pixel 2 xl 
think alot people want certain features told need features personally dont mind bezels dont really find removing innovative dual camera unless suits need personally wireless charging unless comes package really doesnt concern much outside smart watch guess maybe wireless buds love tech alot tech doesnt blow mind pixel btw pretty cool also guess appreciate complex simplistic design likely put pixel 2 strictly 
think thin bezels side may intentional maybe something squeeze fact thumb fingers usually sides holding phone anyway really missing thin bezels perhaps another reason simply follow everyone else might worth looking consider choosing design decisions imperfection phones actually pretty stunning stand theyre attempting thing 
reminds nokia lumia phones tbh 
upper black plastic piece back looks pretty nasty fingerprints 
hmm looks good headphone jack never mind 
it‚Äôs android version iphone love 7 plus 
jack buy
