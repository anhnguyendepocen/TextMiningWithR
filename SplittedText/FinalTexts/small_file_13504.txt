think dex exciting feature new phone able place phone dock desktop experience good step towards integration devices iot isnt really ready yet phone despite trying promote presentation dex seems like actual functional expansion uses phone real next step im looking phone connecting home network moment get home enabling stream te dex interface connected display home meaning seamlessly switch interfaces like phone touch tv smart remote workspace keyboard mouse etc rest mostly seems functionally trivial yes design great really cool thats something already expect flagship phone like great screen theres new software camera last year battery seems ok bixby basically redundant like svoice examples showed dont seem really useful
