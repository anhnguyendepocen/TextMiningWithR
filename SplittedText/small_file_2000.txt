better pixel 2 xl hardware software first time history phones ever skinned beats stock 
cost 
say software looks dated well put skin use nova 
ackward ghimicky second screen one coolest features low power option always keeps updated gives limited accesability phone sleep problem fast charge overheats battery also slightly damaging time nice thing prevoius models ability easily swap batteriesnot easy water proof phones also one favorite features ir blaster use almost everything houseand public something really kept 
208 really true please tell switched samsung s7 htc10 latter sound distortion concert recordings better headphone output xd

bootloop 
thought mclovin 
trash first look understate strengths device sounding enthusiastic competitors arrival products also manage make seem like lgs user interface thing always presume youve never owned cared look lgs past iterations improved comparing theyre mere counterparts justice lgs efforts bit objective help viewers denote whether buy battery life good whilst offering quality first look next time video nature deserves title stacks competition 
wow 
ive seen like 20 youtubers already phone wait month longer get thats dumb lg release ahead iphone note nobody even gon na remember phone time released shame makes think probably wait month two get sale know lg gon na drop price everyone bought iphone note 
worst battery 
nexus 5 anyone

lg great job lg must promote device advertising various promotions like samsung note 8 think lg announce promo saying someone return working lg g6 g5 g4 galaxy s5 s6 s7 note 45 theyll receive 400 discount devices original price buy v30 something tempting like want sell millions 
feel video bit misleading compare v30s battery note 8s say small regards big screen v30s 6in screen closer size s8s 58in note 8s 63 considering v30 smaller screen battery capacity dont see much worry s8 seems make day fine considerably less mahinch v30

crying nonremovable battery gon na whine nonwater resistant phone problem samsung fangays 
don‚Äôt understand reviewers prefer wider lens think mass market use 50mm lens think parents concert goers reporters every time get close enough unless pay enough early enough know ultra wide format addictive love carrying 18mm equivalent lens travels low perspective dynamic second lens usually 50mm equivalent 85mm recently course ideal dual camera set 20mm equivalent 70mm equivalent make 70mm f095 f12 5 axis stabilise lens handheld astro photography like em1 mark2 make shot 110s possible 70mm

xz premium think phone year 
far impressive note8 note8 big disappointment s8 better bigger battery 100 less 
still considering note8 whats point king android lgv30 creators 
6 poled display almost bezelless design reckon pretty much designsize pixel 2 xl front panel

device almost looks like iphone longing review sony xperia xz premium ‚ò∫Ô∏è 
best tech youtuber yet deserves least 2m subs 
also great detailed overview erica griffin always told us sooo much videos running specs could read 
probably next phone assuming price right thing wouldve made better would stereo speakers dont know manufacturers dont think listen music loud like ever laid bed watching movie phone event camera quality audio experience maybe ram would nice 4gb plenty 2gb ram phones still running fast question price undercuts note 8 hard itll kill note 8 almost nothing compelling except spen video features look super dope hopefully itll slightly s8 unlocked 
color test p3 color gamut 
power button 
3300 mah 6 inch screen interested see battery fares
