207 buttons correct order old phones back button right side menu button left habitual thing besides use back button android recent buttoneven backspace order right side yeah perfect 
offset charging port bugs hell

hi samsung s8 silly little thing 7 edge dont like swipping definite beginning end stop stop liked watching app drawer spin im wondering customizable went galaxy s4 galaxy s7 edge thanks

im getting tired iphone guys samsung upgrade 
really stupid placement fingerprint scanner almost always smudge camera lense 
phones looking 
back button right s7 
personally much rather prefer back button right widely used button thats closer palm less finger reach comfortable 
one doesnt like curved screens 
phones become boring like pcs put lipstick pig still pig 
literally cares screen buttons ugly thats pointless critique 
think bought fake iphone 7 cant find headphone jack 
wow phone crazy wish put fingerprint scanner different position though otherwise seems like solid device hopefully samsung convince people theyve learned battery problems note 7 
choose blackberry keyone 
samsung getting respect back first hated amazed 
lg g6 already coming tomorrow wish wouldve waited jk moto z 7 plus g6 live harmony 
s8 copyed lg g6 
whats opinion curved edges display 
optimistic ok suggest phone better departments please dont bother price better phone dis

smartphone¬†is overhyped brings nothing new table larger screen new processors dual camera like almost every single flagship smartphone¬†on market today wide angle well stupid placement fingerprint scanner half time youll pressing camera lense small battery are¬†hypocrites another manufacturer theyd complaining dual camera 2017 battery small placement fingerprint scanner oooh act like¬†children seeing shiny new toy blinded bias deceptive marketing tactics smartphone practical aspects brings nothing new smartphone world maybe iris scanner ill pass better value phones everything and¬†superior huawei lg sony 
s5 dying 3 years phone looks like something would use even longer

awesome 
samsung galaxy s8 stereo speakers 
best tech reviewer 
make america great 2017 
review one best ive seen subject clear concise practical real life etc covers anything youd need know kudos good job well done 
marques didnt forget mention dex samsung desktop experience feature looks like important feature new 
mutch s8 cost 
bixby button side remapped another use 
display nice happened dual front facing harmon speakers bottom speaker terrible dual cameras s7 edge impressed overall phone besides minor things live without s8 isnt much difference already looking forward next samsung flagship 
id hardly say theyre pushing camera seeing camera s7 already one best market regarding worries battery new cpus meant 20 power efficient 
thought finger print sensor good idea get symmetrical looks nice practical 
honestly hope wont issue like galaxy note 7 cause gon na switch phones permanently cancelled fixing darn thing 
honest smart buy s6 much cheaper 800 900 euro telephone course dont buy price need protector whats 50 euro buy s8 950 euro probably buying insurance 9501000 euro think really really expensive fuck 
wait use bixby button shutter button 
iphone 7 plus still winning

keep mind screen area useful metric determining battery drain introduced display 58 qhd display 21 aspect ratio actually puts screen area slightly 55 169 display factor snapdragon 835exynos 8895 reduce power consumption screen likely seems degree increased power savings previous generations might find 3000mah suitable device hell exynos 7420 note 5 gave solid results 3000mah battery larger screen area oldergeneration screen processor specifications straight forward assume performancebattery life spec sheet 
could installed battery half size still would last longer iphone battery
