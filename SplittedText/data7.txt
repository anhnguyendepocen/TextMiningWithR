theres 3600 mah battery s7 edge feeling good choice made got s7 edge overall seems better phone im big fan buttons phone well battery life lastly fingerprint scanner back phone seems really stupid especially given pretty shit place edit also whats s8 s8 whatever happened s8 edge perspective seems like samsung trying copy apple something lol 
since took physical buttons got rid bottom bezel id rather physical buttons though

samsungs ancestors ashamed kick tradition physical home button helps alot turning screen 
hoping theyd release new active well never mind 
sexy sexy thing phone also looks pretty good 
switched s7 edge iphone 7 didnt like s7 missed iphone say kudos samsung s8 phone literally best looking phone market ever seen humble opinion beautifully designed touch wiz greatly improved looks pleasing eyes since marshmallow update nougat even better look since flagship phone features high end specs really anyone cant go wrong one need new phone get phone amazing phone im typing iphone 7 
knew years samsung phones going bomb 
software buttons ugly lol 
337 still usb c 
blow 
would love know allow switch google launcher like note 7 galaxy s7s samsung lot cool software things reason launcher never category image recognition stuff still exists googles launcher dont deal ugly icons samsung bloatware 
tell maturity smartphone market think everything fully optimized dont think nothing left market request companies come innovations speed maxed camera best frankly nothing left smartphone market 
finally something innovative 
compared s7 edge edges site thing looks bulky 
bad finder print placement improvement whatsoever camera battery still mono speaker basically looks like stretched s7 800‚Ç¨ idiots would say dont need im saying good luck purchase oneplus 3 reason update 
best phone 2017 opinion bad thing phone sacrificed practicity symmetry phone chose put fingerprint reader side camera looked symmetrical heart rate sensor think fingerprint reader samsung logo samsung logo would better imo try changing everything elsesmoochperfect like compare masterpiece phone 800 shittysame headphonejackless shitty specs dual useless cameras old obnoxious looking bigass iphone 7 plus smaller screen s8 1200 
battery draw screen depends resolution size 
wallpaper using iphone red 
mention samsung dex 
bet great like g6 tbh 
didnt samsung patent fingerprint reader display could remove home button 
hand every tech reviewer ever 
samsung want oovely nice like iphone butome thing failed follow iphone 
thats dumb placement fingerprint sensor edit completely ignore home button pressuresensitive 
edge fucking edge screen stupid 
saying peace end video makes day 
nice design 
dont really like design 
wouldnt want drop 
think left home button almost trademark cant remove phone doesnt look like samsung anymore could squeezed shape little bit phone smaller bezels could also put closer edge screen overall design ok really liked physical home button 
front facing stereo speakers ffs 
iphone fan phone makes sad next iphone better bezels 
didnt even mention dex stupid reviewer also new proccoser battery efficiant 
helpful info didnt appreciate little ctiticisms kept giving best phone entire world right period 
hate phones 
hopefully choose another way use dedicated button like camera pr launching favorite app personally usually lile everything samsung especailly style icons ui ui ai use actually suppose thanks video always great 
really huge problem latest phones love great screens specs design work ux wonky overlay feels wrong doesnt seem age well 3 colleagues s7 edges lag crash issues meanwhile 6p running like mercury curved screen doesnt make sense want experience watching videos playing games crisp precise curves always glare pixels edge smoothed making part content feel cropped unimportant edge way squeeze ui elements like notifications bar would great 100 flat screen would content edge make feel bezelless smooth guess ocd sorts prefer focus way content delivered container 
think got ta skip one guys keep ur i7s maybe 45 months i8 even note 8 surely going nuclear bomb 
see concerns bixby google assitant phone probably takes lot memory may even add potential problem battery life mentioned wit screen 
didnt watch video s8 waited video 
think im going g6 spec btw im using g3 
im prefer note version rather hope samsung wan na comeout wth note8 
nuke city 
im hate apple product thing made apple like shitüòÇ 
looks like placement fingerprint reader guarantees fingerprints smudge camera lens 100 time poor placement middle phone doesnt reachable love external design otherwise s6 think ill keeping foreseeable future might take another look pixel 
thats smartphone features packed better flexible iphone 
thing disappoints size want phone use one hand galaxy s7s size perfect smallest size size s7 edge thats without considering hard reach corners new bezels 
even note 3 camera better samsung s8 gud design agree edge trend

reviewers ever criticise phone makers poor long term performance samsung especially famous making really fast phones box slow significantly months consistently pushing buggy slow software years reviewers longer give benefit doubt review especially instead making phone software less heavy less app duplication like companies samsung seems intent opposite beautiful looking phone sure seriously reviewers really need start putting pressure manufacturers creating phones last year 
infinity display vs likethealmostbezzlelesslook dunno markymark maybe shouldnt work marketing 
removable battery getting money 
hope wont mind blowing phone 
s8 s8 
nice phone ui though wish phones came stock like oneplus3 
phone tablets 
longer screen means diagonal size screen increases area less battery hard know

ummmmm far s7 seems bit better ill stick 810 s8 design though 
soon southkorea make last smartphone country self ignites üòÅ 
sound systemits bad 
stereo speakers junk 
winner 
fingerprint solution seems like rushed engineering decision compared rumours heard samsung wanting employ screen embedded fingerprint scanner heard problems prototype stage shame couldve really compelling feature really hope samsung improved upon camera hardware im hearing camera performance actually par s7 hope isnt case would misstep opinion seeing camera competition really stepped bit since pixel sony coming interesting camera hardwarefeatures hope s8 holds well year 
marques brownlee lack bezels fucking blind still huge bezels top bottom fucking curve display wtf mentioned bootloader root unlocked dislike 
imessage

applestopcry 
camera software improvements battery even large ass screen energy efficient chip fingerprint location use facial iris recognition still hate dont buy edge wish improved palm rejection 
like xiaomi mix better 
thought back button always right 
main disadvantage fingerprint reader positioning reach rather fact placed right next camera make lens permanently covered skin oils finger bound inadvertently touch lens frequently larger fingers bigger problem baffled one seems thought egregious design misstep reckon spend hours meetings kinds things sometimes end result seems like coffee muffins 
samsung surely best 
back button right side every phone done 
haha samsung tried original finger print scanner completely botched viva la g6 
marquees slowly turned apple fanboy 
get iphone 7 pluswallpaper video 
dont need use fingerprint scanner time coz phone unlock instantly face retina scan awesome throw back 
long time caseys video 
reason bixby simple marques want sell future appliances bixby already installed dominate electronics market well

think samsung pushing hard make os something like tizen better 
finally pro reviews interested amateurs like casey n 
two phones show different temperatures new york 0038 
s8 early review video matters 
pretty sure phone rooted reassign bixby button something better like maybe trigger camera like sony devices
