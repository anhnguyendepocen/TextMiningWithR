marques likes fake bokeh finally admitted google fanboy poty seriously design would smack sales maybe google employ better marketing time litter youtube subways trash ads actually phones stock 1m pixel 1 abysmal even htc company bought done better 
rear camera better portrait mode didnt explain well presentation portrait mode rear camera actually mix hardware machine learning normally calculate depth would two cameras separately spaced way cameras get different perspectives pixel cameras subpixel split right left side effectively creating two perspectives instead difference 1 cm space pixel calculates depth basically space 1 micron incredibly impressive front camera knowledge doesnt purely software 
google 2008 called want design back 
think side bezels good idea squeeze function less ghost inputs display squeezing like u11 
basically it‚Äôs iphone x 999 bit uglier bit slower wireless charging pretty useless squeezing feature nice
