enough space put fingerprint reader camera dont understand didnt 
review im willing watch 
airplane seat belt sign sound heard start 
dont like buttons look maybe samsung allow theme engine include different ones 
regarding display battery draw comments around 500 keep mind samsung pretty good reducing battery draw even increased oled screen sizes finding new screen one also improves battery draw compared previous generation oled screens ultimate factor determine battery draw going suffer screen combined factors fyi 
ridiculous price diffrence s8 s8 couple inches slightly better battery 
dont understand marques says back button placement right problemasians mostly right handed comfortableamericans whole world marques 
nokia 6 tank 
sogood use space 
blaster 
bruh seeing people argue apple vs android cringey af look like bunch 13 year old virgins nothing else going

g6 still chance thought s8 going completely blow competetion away guess boils pricing 
mkbhd best ğŸ˜ğŸ˜ğŸ˜ 
actually people dont know placement fingerprint intended placed awkward area average consumer wont use much use iris scanner instead way training us use ditch fingerprint competently next generations conclusion smart taking away completely become lame consumers time weird place samsung smarter u think 
imagine dropping 
anyone else hear little micro chuckle said still headphone jack talking apple 
fingerprint reader phased would say brand new instant face recognition option quick mean fingerprint reader hardware space used better things bet next phone away altogether 
whole fingerprint sensor back thing dumb sometimes want able wake phone laying table pick cool

think dex exciting feature new phone able place phone dock desktop experience good step towards integration devices iot isnt really ready yet phone despite trying promote presentation dex seems like actual functional expansion uses phone real next step im looking phone connecting home network moment get home enabling stream te dex interface connected display home meaning seamlessly switch interfaces like phone touch tv smart remote workspace keyboard mouse etc rest mostly seems functionally trivial yes design great really cool thats something already expect flagship phone like great screen theres new software camera last year battery seems ok bixby basically redundant like svoice examples showed dont seem really useful
