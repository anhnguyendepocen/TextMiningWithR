bootloop 
thought mclovin 
trash first look understate strengths device sounding enthusiastic competitors arrival products also manage make seem like lgs user interface thing always presume youve never owned cared look lgs past iterations improved comparing theyre mere counterparts justice lgs efforts bit objective help viewers denote whether buy battery life good whilst offering quality first look next time video nature deserves title stacks competition 
wow

don‚Äôt understand reviewers prefer wider lens think mass market use 50mm lens think parents concert goers reporters every time get close enough unless pay enough early enough know ultra wide format addictive love carrying 18mm equivalent lens travels low perspective dynamic second lens usually 50mm equivalent 85mm recently course ideal dual camera set 20mm equivalent 70mm equivalent make 70mm f095 f12 5 axis stabilise lens handheld astro photography like em1 mark2 make shot 110s possible 70mm

also great detailed overview erica griffin always told us sooo much videos running specs could read 
probably next phone assuming price right thing wouldve made better would stereo speakers dont know manufacturers dont think listen music loud like ever laid bed watching movie phone event camera quality audio experience maybe ram would nice 4gb plenty 2gb ram phones still running fast question price undercuts note 8 hard itll kill note 8 almost nothing compelling except spen video features look super dope hopefully itll slightly s8 unlocked

dont mind bezels xl personally dont need phone exactly 100 screen bezels smaller one straight unforgivable though least put capacitive buttons something serves function frees screen space giant bezels serve function straight bad design 
design underwhelming imo 
got bluetooth headphones speakers would agreed eliminating 35mm jack would disasterous however bluetooth wonderful invention cords dangling everywhere wonderful battery life really become much better bluetooth headphones easily last day two without charging charge way hour pairing takes less time untangling headphone cords plugging even 
playing feature locked pixel 2 phones 80 update 
still rocking one m9 would give one shot front facing speakers 
headphone jackmore spendingmore money google smart 
fan side bezels phones smaller side bezels hand palm kept hitting screen hated compromise preordered wait 
opinion new pixel okay iphone letting us iphone 6 glorified long press understand people might mad headphones jack apple first people okay 
like joshs awkward reaction first part hahaha ü§£ 
really hoping v30 pixel clothes good enough buy still 
yes hit nail head side bezels makes look sunken 
sick review one thing might listening properly didnt talk headphone jack great review marques 
apple would proud jack eitherüòÇ 
squeeze feature probably culprit huge side bezels also dont like 3 inches wide much unfortunately small pixel came big top lower bezels guess need wait next year phones come still going sort iphone se small pixel near bezeless design anything 45 5 inches size screen preferably 169 guess asking much 
triggered ok google hell thought match voice profile 
back looks ugly af imo 
great phone‚ùóÔ∏èüëç 
lost faith google 
funny google makes fun apple bcs removed headphones jack thing fuck 
displays ugly side bethels dont match whole design even prefer boring oneplus5 screen design 
hoping better features battery life seems low mah 
get bluetooth headphones cheap fucks buy expensive phone buy decent bluetooth headphones last hours stop living past 
selfy crazy good 
google really need work designs phones 
pixel xl 2 kinda mix phone still google iphone doubt wish google add 2 gigs ram don‚Äôt mind design attractive still getting updates direct google important things pixel

headphone jack would practical phone ever 
marques please keep making videos don‚Äôt want watch unbox guy thanks 
wasnt selfie absolutely kickass wow im sold 
going understand size bezels need bigger avoid touching sides screen fuck samsung hype bezels necessary thats design better others functionality comes design thing didnt realize squeeze action would interfered smaller bezels lot first dislike mkbhd video 
micro sd support case wondering think expandable storage isnt necessary anymore may point data limits shrinking getting expansive every year streaming would happily fit micro sd card would kill average persons data plan matter hours 128gb max storage option system apps formatting 
waiting video 
google reimagine design concept flagship devices like s8note 8and course iphones drsign way better thisüëéüëéüëéüëé 
cares side bezels going way edge though actually find bit annoying holding phones seems middle make everyone happy headphone jacks thing pastits year yet pple still seem bothered phones exact specs 
poor design google ü§¶üè ª ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

headphone jack going buy 
think phone best phone year fit wants stock android amazing software support front facing speakers yes phone coming nexus 6p user fits wants best thats ill getting pixel 2 xl 
think alot people want certain features told need features personally dont mind bezels dont really find removing innovative dual camera unless suits need personally wireless charging unless comes package really doesnt concern much outside smart watch guess maybe wireless buds love tech alot tech doesnt blow mind pixel btw pretty cool also guess appreciate complex simplistic design likely put pixel 2 strictly 
think thin bezels side may intentional maybe something squeeze fact thumb fingers usually sides holding phone anyway really missing thin bezels perhaps another reason simply follow everyone else might worth looking consider choosing design decisions imperfection phones actually pretty stunning stand theyre attempting thing 
reminds nokia lumia phones tbh 
upper black plastic piece back looks pretty nasty fingerprints 
hmm looks good headphone jack never mind 
it‚Äôs android version iphone love 7 plus

rear camera better portrait mode didnt explain well presentation portrait mode rear camera actually mix hardware machine learning normally calculate depth would two cameras separately spaced way cameras get different perspectives pixel cameras subpixel split right left side effectively creating two perspectives instead difference 1 cm space pixel calculates depth basically space 1 micron incredibly impressive front camera knowledge doesnt purely software 
google 2008 called want design back 
think side bezels good idea squeeze function less ghost inputs display squeezing like u11 
basically it‚Äôs iphone x 999 bit uglier bit slower wireless charging pretty useless squeezing feature nice

love lg 
1000 note 8 dedicated dac doesnt back water proofing military grade shock proofing actually allow carefree usage phone sure ticks boxes course extra features note 8 like curved screes edges makes super fragile pen hardly even 10 buyers use iris scanner really required wins v30 way useful 
want know would lg put head phone jack bottom please reply 
much 
allowed review lg phones 
doubt android get get better üòç want one 
literally copy galaxy s8 amazing 
lg g2 loved v models didnt come uk went nexus 6p changed mistake nightmare im due upgrade think im going back lg one pity carphone warehouse sell point missed comes b headphones 
still waiting full review 
loved snuck video pewdie pie famous saying n word hilarious easter egg paying attention great video happy subbed 
wow phone looks awesome 
features parts phone phone one better 
dont think gloss headphone jack like lgs putting best audio processing ever featured phone want compare something compare dedicated audio player theres literally noone puting hw phone rather manufacturers removing jack sake profit bt audio satisfy headphone user since inferior quality like replacing camera phone vga 2 mp sensor extend usb cable could plug better yet best proprietary camera connect wireless would also lower quality would cause much bigger uproar would also made phone accesory expensive 
dont like stock android skin usually use minimalistic icons make cleaner 
please help find wallpaper 
definitely buy one price low enough price close iphone samsung ill buy one got ta see dough personnel first
