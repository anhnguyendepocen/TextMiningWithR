imo think samsung better deal apple everyone keep putting iphones theyre vastly different everyone know apple users dont buy phones reasons 
sorry say went design wrong design detail detail awful example usb c port bottom entered pushed back phone screen comes far samsung evidently couldnt create thin enough screen also one main reasons apple better every way dont ship something perfect apple would wait display technology thin enough dont move usb c port apple would developed finger print system works glass rather bodging putting back front phone admit looks good back damn right ugly software pixby thing awful name swipe left doesnt even follow colour scheme rest phone looks like seperate app thats ported different os next different assistant lazy samsung needs make os wants chance competing apple poor overcomplicated attempt apple apple failed always samsung understand design detail 
donâ€™t read profile name 
im impressed phone going cost around 900 euros europe ridicules look specs better save money wait oneplus four 5

offset charging port bugs hell

im getting tired iphone guys samsung upgrade 
really stupid placement fingerprint scanner almost always smudge camera lense 
phones looking 
back button right s7 
personally much rather prefer back button right widely used button thats closer palm less finger reach comfortable 
one doesnt like curved screens 
phones become boring like pcs put lipstick pig still pig 
literally cares screen buttons ugly thats pointless critique 
think bought fake iphone 7 cant find headphone jack 
wow phone crazy wish put fingerprint scanner different position though otherwise seems like solid device hopefully samsung convince people theyve learned battery problems note 7 
choose blackberry keyone 
samsung getting respect back first hated amazed 
lg g6 already coming tomorrow wish wouldve waited jk moto z 7 plus g6 live harmony

really dont like placement scanner youd smudge glass camera trying find pretty stupid imho 
apple make full screen iphone september accused copying renders full display iphone leaked months ago wayyyyy samsung s8 even iphone 7 
south korean propaganda garbage products made china buying anything samsung abroad 
last samsung note 7 gta bomb mode looks like samsung serious time 
please make 21 aspect ratio industry standard across phones desktop monitors 4k could actually 4000 pixels wide come man 
temperature different two phones 
one doesnt give damn voice assistants samsung makes dedicated button 
bix whatğŸ˜¦

smartphoneÂ is overhyped brings nothing new table larger screen new processors dual camera like almost every single flagship smartphoneÂ on market today wide angle well stupid placement fingerprint scanner half time youll pressing camera lense small battery areÂ hypocrites another manufacturer theyd complaining dual camera 2017 battery small placement fingerprint scanner oooh act likeÂ children seeing shiny new toy blinded bias deceptive marketing tactics smartphone practical aspects brings nothing new smartphone world maybe iris scanner ill pass better value phones everything andÂ superior huawei lg sony 
s5 dying 3 years phone looks like something would use even longer

samsung galaxy s8 stereo speakers 
best tech reviewer 
make america great 2017 
review one best ive seen subject clear concise practical real life etc covers anything youd need know kudos good job well done 
marques didnt forget mention dex samsung desktop experience feature looks like important feature new 
mutch s8 cost 
bixby button side remapped another use 
display nice happened dual front facing harmon speakers bottom speaker terrible dual cameras s7 edge impressed overall phone besides minor things live without s8 isnt much difference already looking forward next samsung flagship 
id hardly say theyre pushing camera seeing camera s7 already one best market regarding worries battery new cpus meant 20 power efficient 
thought finger print sensor good idea get symmetrical looks nice practical 
honestly hope wont issue like galaxy note 7 cause gon na switch phones permanently cancelled fixing darn thing 
honest smart buy s6 much cheaper 800 900 euro telephone course dont buy price need protector whats 50 euro buy s8 950 euro probably buying insurance 9501000 euro think really really expensive fuck 
wait use bixby button shutter button

keep mind screen area useful metric determining battery drain introduced display 58 qhd display 21 aspect ratio actually puts screen area slightly 55 169 display factor snapdragon 835exynos 8895 reduce power consumption screen likely seems degree increased power savings previous generations might find 3000mah suitable device hell exynos 7420 note 5 gave solid results 3000mah battery larger screen area oldergeneration screen processor specifications straight forward assume performancebattery life spec sheet 
could installed battery half size still would last longer iphone battery 
galaxy 8 maxx headphone jack 4500mah battery coming lateer year

sexy sexy thing phone also looks pretty good

software buttons ugly lol 
337 still usb c 
blow 
would love know allow switch google launcher like note 7 galaxy s7s samsung lot cool software things reason launcher never category image recognition stuff still exists googles launcher dont deal ugly icons samsung bloatware 
tell maturity smartphone market think everything fully optimized dont think nothing left market request companies come innovations speed maxed camera best frankly nothing left smartphone market 
finally something innovative 
compared s7 edge edges site thing looks bulky 
bad finder print placement improvement whatsoever camera battery still mono speaker basically looks like stretched s7 800â‚¬ idiots would say dont need im saying good luck purchase oneplus 3 reason update 
best phone 2017 opinion bad thing phone sacrificed practicity symmetry phone chose put fingerprint reader side camera looked symmetrical heart rate sensor think fingerprint reader samsung logo samsung logo would better imo try changing everything elsesmoochperfect like compare masterpiece phone 800 shittysame headphonejackless shitty specs dual useless cameras old obnoxious looking bigass iphone 7 plus smaller screen s8 1200 
battery draw screen depends resolution size 
wallpaper using iphone red 
mention samsung dex 
bet great like g6 tbh 
didnt samsung patent fingerprint reader display could remove home button 
hand every tech reviewer ever 
samsung want oovely nice like iphone butome thing failed follow iphone 
thats dumb placement fingerprint sensor edit completely ignore home button pressuresensitive 
edge fucking edge screen stupid 
saying peace end video makes day 
nice design 
dont really like design 
wouldnt want drop 
think left home button almost trademark cant remove phone doesnt look like samsung anymore could squeezed shape little bit phone smaller bezels could also put closer edge screen overall design ok really liked physical home button 
front facing stereo speakers ffs 
iphone fan phone makes sad next iphone better bezels 
didnt even mention dex stupid reviewer also new proccoser battery efficiant 
helpful info didnt appreciate little ctiticisms kept giving best phone entire world right period 
hate phones 
hopefully choose another way use dedicated button like camera pr launching favorite app personally usually lile everything samsung especailly style icons ui ui ai use actually suppose thanks video always great 
really huge problem latest phones love great screens specs design work ux wonky overlay feels wrong doesnt seem age well 3 colleagues s7 edges lag crash issues meanwhile 6p running like mercury curved screen doesnt make sense want experience watching videos playing games crisp precise curves always glare pixels edge smoothed making part content feel cropped unimportant edge way squeeze ui elements like notifications bar would great 100 flat screen would content edge make feel bezelless smooth guess ocd sorts prefer focus way content delivered container 
think got ta skip one guys keep ur i7s maybe 45 months i8 even note 8 surely going nuclear bomb 
see concerns bixby google assitant phone probably takes lot memory may even add potential problem battery life mentioned wit screen 
didnt watch video s8 waited video 
think im going g6 spec btw im using g3 
im prefer note version rather hope samsung wan na comeout wth note8 
nuke city 
im hate apple product thing made apple like shitğŸ˜‚ 
looks like placement fingerprint reader guarantees fingerprints smudge camera lens 100 time poor placement middle phone doesnt reachable love external design otherwise s6 think ill keeping foreseeable future might take another look pixel 
thats smartphone features packed better flexible iphone 
thing disappoints size want phone use one hand galaxy s7s size perfect smallest size size s7 edge thats without considering hard reach corners new bezels 
even note 3 camera better samsung s8 gud design agree edge trend

reviewers ever criticise phone makers poor long term performance samsung especially famous making really fast phones box slow significantly months consistently pushing buggy slow software years reviewers longer give benefit doubt review especially instead making phone software less heavy less app duplication like companies samsung seems intent opposite beautiful looking phone sure seriously reviewers really need start putting pressure manufacturers creating phones last year 
infinity display vs likethealmostbezzlelesslook dunno markymark maybe shouldnt work marketing 
removable battery getting money 
hope wont mind blowing phone 
s8 s8 
nice phone ui though wish phones came stock like oneplus3 
phone tablets 
longer screen means diagonal size screen increases area less battery hard know

ummmmm far s7 seems bit better ill stick 810 s8 design though 
soon southkorea make last smartphone country self ignites ğŸ˜ 
sound systemits bad 
stereo speakers junk 
winner 
fingerprint solution seems like rushed engineering decision compared rumours heard samsung wanting employ screen embedded fingerprint scanner heard problems prototype stage shame couldve really compelling feature really hope samsung improved upon camera hardware im hearing camera performance actually par s7 hope isnt case would misstep opinion seeing camera competition really stepped bit since pixel sony coming interesting camera hardwarefeatures hope s8 holds well year 
marques brownlee lack bezels fucking blind still huge bezels top bottom fucking curve display wtf mentioned bootloader root unlocked dislike

camera software improvements battery even large ass screen energy efficient chip fingerprint location use facial iris recognition still hate dont buy edge wish improved palm rejection 
like xiaomi mix better 
thought back button always right 
main disadvantage fingerprint reader positioning reach rather fact placed right next camera make lens permanently covered skin oils finger bound inadvertently touch lens frequently larger fingers bigger problem baffled one seems thought egregious design misstep reckon spend hours meetings kinds things sometimes end result seems like coffee muffins 
samsung surely best 
back button right side every phone done 
haha samsung tried original finger print scanner completely botched viva la g6 
marquees slowly turned apple fanboy 
get iphone 7 pluswallpaper video 
dont need use fingerprint scanner time coz phone unlock instantly face retina scan awesome throw back

reason bixby simple marques want sell future appliances bixby already installed dominate electronics market well

think samsung pushing hard make os something like tizen better 
finally pro reviews interested amateurs like casey n 
two phones show different temperatures new york 0038 
s8 early review video matters 
pretty sure phone rooted reassign bixby button something better like maybe trigger camera like sony devices

great review always samsung needs ditch voice well new assistant stock android incorporates multiple apps time really point reinventing wheel longer love samsung galaxy devices wish would slack completely copying google already exists accounts lags operation every time owned galaxy use googles launcher turn voice tw got old quick appreciate attempts minimize impact still need get closer stock adding im useful features os

samsung probably couldve squeezed 100 extra mah battery probably wanted play safe 
pixpi disabled

dont like like home buttons 
samsung changes whole phone nobody gives fuck say revolutionary innovative apple changes color iphone everybody like amazinnggg

looking comments galaxy definitely loved hated phone collection see good mix evolution conservation samsung knew better completely boost everything phone note 7 incident still able surmount beautiful complexion architecture s8 mean fingerprint issue due onscreen technology available yet also may way emphasize iris scanner ive seen amazingly quick knock phone similarities s7 expect apples iphone 8 evolution 7 addition aha new display new fingerprint system iphone galaxy provide epitome 2017 phone line pixel well maybe phones perks well faults im still fan removal 35mm jack iphone vulnerability screen need appreciate phones like provide diversity phone world matter side choose consider pros cons galaxy iphone neither perfect companies approach phones subtle evolution complete overhaul greater chance affecting sales supplementing whats giving big bucks 
1080 man live venezuela conection sucks ass im gon na spend 2 hours waiting load still love marques tho

tbh could choose note 7 would choose note 7 like corners sharper sharp note 7 personally thought best design ever came edges side subtle perfect also physical home button thing feel like samsung becoming less unique android phones ones already ditched physical button software buttons bottom kind turned s8 
case makers gon na nightmares making case 
samsung smashing apple 
moment realize american companies longer lead innovation creativity design good job korea next one china 
see changes except display finger print scanner placement complete goof right next camera smoking

think dex exciting feature new phone able place phone dock desktop experience good step towards integration devices iot isnt really ready yet phone despite trying promote presentation dex seems like actual functional expansion uses phone real next step im looking phone connecting home network moment get home enabling stream te dex interface connected display home meaning seamlessly switch interfaces like phone touch tv smart remote workspace keyboard mouse etc rest mostly seems functionally trivial yes design great really cool thats something already expect flagship phone like great screen theres new software camera last year battery seems ok bixby basically redundant like svoice examples showed dont seem really useful

review matters 
best dude 
may incorrect wasnt rumor samsung developing technology install fingerprint reader embedded beneath display claimed unable develop time launch could explain unusual placement current fingerprint reader 
mean kinda obvious placed fingerprintÂ sensor back wanted users use iris scanner ofteni mean common sensethey trynna things differentunlike apple 
back button left user wants prefer right 
one going flop year 
finally use screen navigation buttons like theyre â€‹supposed theyre still wrong position 
boom 
gigantic beautiful screened phone meh batteries slowno software updates duplicative appsfeatures badly placed fingerprint scanner staying pixel 
isolinear chips 605

beast phone samsung could use clout tell carriers install removable apps 
quality review always mike 
vmware announced run vmware machines dex thats big news sure useful definitely fun play maybe even emulate mac os eat heart iphone 
even though screen looks gorgeous word mr mobile dunno looks kinda odd long rectangular stretched display contradict almost looks kinda ugly g6 better ratio imo 
signs stupidity fingerprint scanner back next camera 
excellent 1st look video also happy birthday sir 
honestly since rumors gave away months ago excited 
nothing new sun remember heard smartphone capable play computer beforeit 2 years ago oh btw smartphone sporting iris scanner according people weird slow phone

already computer need s8 play computer 
mrmobile nice review mate like subscribed 
im definitely geting upgrade available tired galaxy s5 
happy birthday mike 
navbar looks ugly s8 couldnt include one gesture mode like moto g5 plus 
iris scanner phones gradually stealing identity bit bit 
ugly design horrible fingerprint scanner placement redundant assistant rip continuum likely ultra expensive nno thanks samsung never owned crappy phones never bad apple 
gorgeous cant wait note 8 
like lg g6 better 
hopefully dex feature hardware side rather software ported old device like galaxy note 4 ğŸ˜‚ know nougat capable multitasking windows like dex better note 4s multiwindows 
one reviewer say processor ram s8s 
s7 edge still rocks dont think ill need upgrade time soon 
camera capture raw files 
hmmm 
question always ask every new phone install apps sd card 
fingerprint reader high kind ruining whole point easy reach looks stupid talk smuges camera also anyone else find glarereflection infinity pool style edges distracting hell 
either south korea opposite majority people left handed samsung money left pay ergonomics department thats logical explanation placement fingerprint scanner 
iphone 7 much better fingerprint scanner better speakers great camera lagfree os regular updates list goes 
bought s7 like year ago release new phone one price dropped 
great looking hardware best class screen im sure laggy software 
headphone jack rare sight 
think lg g6 look stronger body s8 s8 gorgeous phone lets wait see think samsung galaxy s8 line sales beat flagship sale company 
looks like shit 
always click videos first mr fisher keep great work 
750 s8 850 s8 
march 29 1983 happy birthday ğŸ‚ michael fisher

thought real hes right left sided back button ive s6 year still makes mistake 
beautiful phone awesome video kinda really want one im note guy 
well voice galaxy grand neo google assistant watch 
lg g6 seems promising fingerprint scanner small battery camera improvements probably ridiculous price leaks said starting 750 dealbreakers opinion bad apple leaving headphone jack miss 
back button right guys 
prefer back button right side im left handed feels awkward reaching back button close thumb understand right handed may prefer left 
pricing bestbuycom 
another great comprehensive handson video mr mobile nice one

dwight schrute 
love videos michael hair point must mentioned 
im really excited desktop feature 
wan na see lil wayne pour champagne phone 
got headphone jack waterproof im love 
im still happy oneplus3t 
improved exploding feature 
dont get wrong critic people comment sections pure imbeciles experience yes guts say actually eversoawkward placement fingerprint scanner well actually bad would expect coming guy came see s8 well first saw actually thought finger print scanner placement huge fiasco comes realization get used finger print scanner placement later plus thered reason use fingerprint scanner since one called gimick thought gimick named iris scanner actually works fast fingerprint scanner whereas multiplies rate security really phone flaws still fingerprint scanner arguement pretty much misleading 
bruh wtf hair 
nice short look audio s7 wasnt great departmentdid fix year 
cant hide buttons 
google made car would called google drive 
phone manufacturers ever give us year year bigger screen phone size ratio less bezels higher ram better camera new placement fingerprint scanner home buttons phone jack battery give us something enough last days look next best thing end looking next charging spot 
hate curved screen wish could get specs lg g6 
sure purdy 
great video would describe s8s haptic feedback similar iphone taptic engine feel good iphones 
come 128gb variant sd cards slow phone fuck downnnn 
fan round screen edges 
damn fingerprint location disappointment 
phablet 
ballers dont buy samsung 
im waiting galaxy s9 rumors 
overhyped phone disappointment nothing see 
like ur waiting note 8 
phone looks gorgeous 
problem removing physical home button accidentally pressing home button instead keyboard space bar especially thin bottom bezels another ergonomical nightmare typical copycat fashion samsung offered us tactile feedback like iphone 7 another moving part wear vibrate ruin battery life samsung always secondrate manufacturer like 1990s early 2000s bplayer using copycat marketing learned apple also bplayer 1990s prior jobs return quality manufacturers like nokia motorola panasonic durable longlasting products need fuck samsung 
gorgeous smartphone top line specs 
iphone home botton 
still happy oneplus 3t dashcharge 6gb ram instant fingerprint reader 
wish hadnt gotten lg v20 replacement note7 patience wait 6 months sigh 
hmmm im kinda digging fingerprint sensor location pretty awkward might give test drive see like 
like thin bezels give taller screens large phones phones fit hand 
s8 day long 
cant help feeling samsung went conservative approach time round hoped something better 
3000mah battery wonder thats enough seems low point phone apart ridiculous fingerprint sensor placement 
dont know everyone complain nice could done better still really nice 
god navigation buttons awful looking ğŸ¤¢ 
daaam nailed design one looks like years ahead s7 somewhat dissapointing though look hood 
one gorgeous looking phone remember s5 looks like wow improvement better looking iphone time one best looking phone 
howwwwwwwwww much 
samy back stronger ever tremendous phone bigly leap smartphone design phone tall could used wall phone beautiful want grab bzlz ladies gents may present new galaxy s8 plus 
man im torn samsung capability making amazing phones try compete wrong things google assistant already great youre going put android phones youll get waste resources bixby make worse skimped fingerprint reader like wth placement much rather samsung develop screen fingerprint sensor bixby 
didnt think fingerprint placement would badbut considering nothing terms increasing battery unacceptable 
damn black pretty nicer shade black s7 edge also like metal band sides black wish migrated updates ui s7 guess forget 
great hardware software android still cant daily driver app quality still never live life without imessage samsung nailed design apples phone year better blow everyones mind hardware wise want phone running ios 
back right patrician way use smartphone 
real innovation dont let phone companies trick asked comments worth upgrade 
still waiting android n update note 5 done android bought iphone 7 get updates asap 
holy fucking shit black s8 fucking pretty honestly say event shit bixbie seems like bunch crap 
shouldnt used green background technical specifications makes hard read texts 
super hesitant grab phone due prevalent bixby seems os resembles halfbaked svoice thank

ive owned several galaxys previously looks like nice phone im still going lg g6 dual camera much killer feature whereas s8 simply polished evolution except truly ridiculous fingerprint scanner placement gimmicky bixby silly price rather game changing usable innovation g6

end day fucking phone much shitty features phone opinion 
infinity hahahahahahaha 
back button right side works better 
software stuff going make gs7 
looking forward new iphone 
fingerprint scanner location high koreans long fingers 
thought asian man black first glance due lighting lol 
omg people got stop calling infiniti screen clearly s6 edge minus home button 
vs lg g6 
controversial opinion like back button right makes sense right handed like people use phone one hand dont strech across screen hit back key doesnt really matter small screen short fingers like large galaxy s7 edge screen makes sense 
nice something mary hair lol 
anyone else thinks mi mix better looking 
galaxy s7 ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜‚ camera small battery screen cool thats oh like bigsby bigspie whatever 
someone never liked samsung phone design beautiful looks like phone renders years past ended wrong

meh think iphone worth wait 
2 break dealers edge display ridiculously reflective fingerprint scanner ridiculous position 
yup getting one 
getting s7 edge last year told wont get samsung anymore theyre expensive buy expensive repair plus glass breaks easily watching s8 looks like might change mind 
back button belongs right always 
nah bro got zte zmax pro im used handling large itemsğŸ˜ 
kinda think display looks overkill 
5 inch google pixel 1080p screen likely higher fps benchmarks due resolution 
bootloader unlockable get aosp 
sd capable 
sad phone going best selling smartphone samsung 
mint sim stuff legit 
buautiful 
sexy phone ill give 
wait isolinear chips towards end video 
back button right side dont want stretch thumb one end another go back 
wish etching stars galaxy back phoneit looks dull 
sell 1 free fire extinguisher iphone still feels expensive premium copycat lol 
shouldnt like back button right time changed huawei also lets customize layout buttons 
worst update since galaxy s6s6 edge offered smaller battery kept sealed since waterresistance microsd slot s8 basically s7 edge removing home button increasing display size vertically offering voice assistant nobody use like iphone 6s went 7 three years right amount time notice actual improvements endless yearly updates 
galaxy s7 means dont need phone time soon 
ran gta 5 s8 definitely blowup ğŸ˜‚ 
thank fot honest review buddy 
good realeased means get cheaper samsung galaxy s7 edge 
g6 better sorry samsung 
thank honest review bud

phone god iphone bow 
sticking z3 compact another year great phone best two features fit pocket use one handed 
thats tall phone 
incredible technical masterpiece like lot 
wonder much pay motorola ideas like mr mobile say advertisement giants going put phones handscant wait 2 see versus vid g6 s8 
curved edge display looks terrible 
lg g6 better aesthetics 
dont know whos attractive looking phone michael Â you look sharp man keep good work 
someone speedtest pls 
soooo plus version replacement note minus pen note8 going thing 
ughhhhh really looking forward keyone difficult decide phione hurry ass blackberry youre screwing things 
right minds would think return button right side 
dont phone companies make really good simple phone like last year htc 10 good speaker dac camera yknow improvement essential stuffs instead throwing full bunch gimmicks 
reason fingerprint scanner lackluster want open phone want everyone new irisscanner facial recognition unlock system fingerprint scanner great innovation phone safety samsung probably trying push security feature forefront less aggressively apple pushed wireless headphonesheadphone jack removal think ultimately apple little hasty overvalued phone thickness assumed people would value honest could anyone notice 3 mms difference thickness put case phone throws away efforts 
time us buy s7 cheaper price ğŸ˜‚ 
lg g6 better every aspect first come huge screen similar one better battery better camera also waterproof wireless charging etc fingerprint sensor lg right spot cheaper likely 
pre ordered mine couple hours ago uk feels like long im gon na get though april 19th im excited jump back android though 
like samsung taking last name 
expensive country samsung software always lag short time dont know like s8 dont know ğŸ™ğŸ™ğŸ™

best phone apple 8 know ios design thing nothing new 8 new 
yesit 
looks like typical samsung flagship release good intentions dragged minor inconveniences bloatware samsung app better stock 
display looks amazing even camera edge infinity display looks gorgeous 
swapping placement flash fingerprint scanner would allow us unlock phone without touching camera lens left hand since us right handed scanner right convenience masses offence lefted folks 
meanwhile apple making history painting phones red

poled still slight grain seen phones like g flex 2 get phone id coming flex 2 grain although subtle kind annoying
